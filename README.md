## Dependencies

## Overview

This repository provides the essential codebase to run custom RL policies on an [Unitree H1-2](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/H1_developer/About_H1-2) robot.

Currently the RL training uses [Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab).
The sim2sim validation is done with [Mujoco](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco).
The sim2real deployment pipe depends on [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python).

The project is structured around three main packages:
- **biped_assets**: Manages the models of the robot
- **biped_deploy**: Handles deployment-related functionalities (sim2sim and sim2real).
- **biped_tasks**: Contains the core definition of the training environment for the robot.

Both `biped_deploy` and `biped_assets` are adapted from the template provided for [Isaac Lab Projects](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate) to facilitate integration.

## Usage

This project has been packaged using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To run a training:
```bash
uv run scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task Isaac-Velocity-Flat-H12_12dof-v0
```
This command initiates the training process for the specified task.

For the sim2sim:
```bash
uv run scripts/deploy/sim2sim.py
```
This command runs the trained policy inside of MuJoCo.

For the sim2real:
```bash
uv run scripts/deploy/sim2real.py
```
This command can be used to deploy the trained policy onto a real robot.

Note: in order to avoid installing `isaacsim` for deployment, add `--package biped_deploy` to the uv command.
